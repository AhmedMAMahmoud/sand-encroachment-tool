# sand-encroachment-tool
Sand Encroachment Tool (SET) is developed with JavaScript in Google Earth Engine and ArcGIS to monitor sand dune movement using remote sensing. The tool utilizes image processing and geospatial analysis techniques to detecting sand cover area changes and generating land cover classification maps that demonstrate the changes over time and the spread of sand areas. The tool also detects the displacement and the direction of movement of specified individual dunes following the classification of sand cover areas.
